# Mentisano Project

Project Mentisano is an applicable project and versatile with great advantages and challenges. The gigantic fish in this project are to make mental health accessible and accessible but respect its privacy and sensitivity. Creating a multidisciplinary application that provides everything under one roof is a daunting task as well as providing and organizing the necessary mental health information. From data collection to fact-processing to the dissemination of information forms the basis of this work. 

The remarkable success of this project could be its ability to identify real sympathizers and have them on board. 

With these features and applications, we hope we can bring the spark of good health to human health. Considering our future, we intend to send it, and with the hiring service, you may hire someone like OLA in the years to come. 

Mentisano provides Meditation and relaxing breathing videos that can help people manage insomnia, depression, anxiety, improve well-being and quality of life. One can achieve it during a panic attack and feel at ease. It provides an ASMR that helps relieve the symptoms of negative emotions. It will help to reduce chronic pain in some people. A disruptive game may promote sensible mental escape but may offer users the benefits of self-confidence, personal growth.

# Problem Statement

The only puzzling and growing problem of mental health is our primary statement of the problem and external activities involved due to the unhealthy mental structure. We want to find solutions through effective and flexible recruitment of technological advances made that way, to create a better future. Loneliness, which is considered a seriously problem, might not be in India yet but in countries like Japan. We assume someday people here too will consider it as a critical issue and then our app will come into the scene. People in America also have not considered this is a prominent issue and this solution is not implemented there. So, this might be something new and innovating in India. We think this might solve employment issue also as people willing to collaborate with us doesn't need a degree or qualification just a good attitude and background. They will be taught to be professional. Young people studying can also work with us so this is basically good for both sides.


# BACKGROUND RESEARCH
In Japan, many people die in their apartments alone and people only find out about it when the apartment starts smelling. This is because people have no family there and they are lonely and die alone. The people took this as a serious issue and started a company that rents people who will act as their families. But such an issue is not taken seriously in India the issue of loneliness OfCourse hence keeping this and mind and searching about this for a long time we came up with this idea. In the covid tines also we have witnessed that how people were left lonely and due to which they faced severe anxiety problems. In our application, we have introduced the same thing that is introducing the rent a person system, mental health games and wellness videos, book a therapist, etc. It is also eye-witnessed as how people suffered the outage of resources in their most difficult times and we have done the same thing to improvise and better the conditions.  


# Proposed System
Our aim is to find resourceful information about how the people suffering from mental issue and how our app can help them overcome it. By using flutter dart, we have created the app and plan to use other web tools to expand our app from this level. By collecting information from the survey of our app we can improve the user experience.
The aim is to help people during panic attacks as it is still not treated seriously by some people. Our app provides features as breathing exercise which is considered as a useful technique in such scenarios. 


# Goals and Objectives
It will help lonely people to rent to a family member or friend. People can be too busy or too busy trying to connect with people in the real world offline. What if you were dating someone and you were cooked by your mother at home, and someone was going out with you. It is an ALL-in-1 app. As is often the case in modern times, we are so preoccupied with our own work or effort that we neglect to interact with one another in real life or to spend time with family. Our app can be a reminder to people that self-care and love for others are just as important as your professional life.

# Overall Description
Let us take a trip back in time and try to recall the last time your parents, friends, teachers, or relatives talked to you about your worries, issues, or tried to understand you if you were feeling depressed, unable to complete daily duties, eating less, experiencing changes in mood, or being scared?
The truth is there are many reasons that people might find it difficult to open about a mental health problem. They worry that people may think you are ‘weird’ or leave you out. Not wanting to be treated any differently creates issues and they never get treated or will not talk to people around them which can be dangerous.
“One out of four children in India are going through depression” — WHO
“More than 50% of people in India facing severe depression in India.”
