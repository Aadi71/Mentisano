# mental_health

Let’s stroll down the memory lane and try to remember when was the last time your parents, friends, teachers, or relatives consulted to you about your stress, problems, or tried to understand you if you might facing any difficulty before you might be feeling low, inability to perform daily tasks, eating less, mood swings or scared?
The truth is there are many reasons that people might find it difficult to open up about a mental health problem. They worry that people may think you’re ‘weird’ or leave you out. Not wanting to be treated any differently creates issues and they never get treated or won’t talk to people around them which can be dangerous.
“One out of four children in India is going through depression” — WHO
“More than 50% of people in India facing severe depression in India.”
These are some facts and here we are not to count the facts as they may get more worst if we start stating all. At first let’s know what actually is mental health, in scientific language: Mental health is a positive concept. It encompasses our emotions, our psyche, and our social interactions.
And in layman’s terms, it is our thinking, approach towards something, and feelings.
But are we here to teach you mental health, No!
We are here to make you practice how to take care of your mental health. And promise yourself, to never get hesitant to share your problems or to seek professional help.
Today’s global challenges have made clear the need for players across the behavioral health landscape and continuing to that Mentisano, brings to you ample applications to deal with stress, anxiety, depression, loneliness, and tiredness. Here is the gist of all features:

##Engaging Games — If the user plans to play a game to use their time efficiently they can come here and play flip the cards. Where the user has to flip the cards and match similar pictures. There are three levels of this game based on the hardness level.
Why this game is special? So this flip the card game uses your brain memory and accelerates to imagine and learn quick. This is also beneficial when you’re feeling depressed or anxiety level is high, as its a human tendency whenever you get a matching pair, a pinch of dopamine may release to lower your stress level plus make you feel happy as a symbol of victory.

And then congrats, finally you have booked yourself a person to make you feel relax and happy.

The project, Mentisano is a multi-faceted and relevant project with major advantages and tacky challenges. The bigger fish to fry in this project is to make mental health accessible and available yet respect the privacy and sensitivity aspect of it. Making a multi-varied app providing everything under one roof is a substantial task along with bringing and editing the requisite information of mental health. From collecting information to scrutinizing the facts to disseminating information makes up the bulwark of this project.
As it is said that “The taste of the pudding is in the eating it”, similarly the litmus test of this project’s success is its ability to set up successful “Rent a friend” appointments and offer soothing and relaxing solutions like music and right kind of meditation. A major achievement of this project would be its ability to identify genuinely compassionate people and have them on board.
With these features and applications, we hope we may bring a spark of positivity to people’s life. Considering our future plans, we are aiming for its deployment, and for the rent-up service, you may rent a person like an OLA in the coming years.

Thank you for reading, we are always open for suggestions!
